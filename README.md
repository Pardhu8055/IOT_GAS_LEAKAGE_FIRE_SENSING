# IOT_GAS_LEAKAGE_FIRE_SENSING
REAL TIME GAS LEAKAGE AND FIRE SENSING SYSTEM FOR INDUSTRIAL SECURITY

We all know the gas leakage issue in Industrial places we all seen recently in Visakhapatnam which made huge human loss and a big disaster due to harmful gas leakage during pandemic time and also so many incidents where happen so to over come this we created a IOT device to identify if any harmful gas is deducted it alerts and rise alarm to take action to implement this we have used Arduino, MQ2 gas Sensor (to detect gases in atmosphere), IR flame Sensor(if any fire catches to get alert), Buzzer (to get notified by sound immediately), GSM Module (to send the alarm notification to mobile to alert and take necessary needs)
